"""Bundle the artifacts `zig build` produced, tagged for the platform they are for.

A wheel is a zip plus metadata: the platform tag is a string, not something
derived from the binaries. So the wheel for any target can be produced on any
host — the usual reason to build wheels on the target platform is that the
*compiler* has to run there, and `zig build -Dtarget=...` removes that reason.

    zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-linux-gnu.2.17
    BLOB_WHEEL_PLATFORM=manylinux_2_17_x86_64 uv build --wheel

With no override the tag is inferred from the host, which is correct for the
ordinary native build.

The tag is `py3-none-<platform>`: platform-specific because it carries a native
library, but ABI-agnostic because ctypes binds at runtime rather than against
the CPython C API. That is the concrete win over the nanobind build, which
needed a separate wheel per interpreter version.

Which artifacts go in cannot be a plain `force-include` of `zig-out/lib`.
`zig build` does not clear that directory between targets, so after a
cross-build followed by a native one it holds both — and the names do not
separate them: `libblobodbc.so` there may be a stale Linux core, while
`blobodbc.so` is the SQLite extension and is genuinely correct on macOS
too. So each file is checked against the tag by its own magic number, which is
the only unambiguous signal. A macOS wheel shipping a Linux `.so` installs and
imports fine right up until the ctypes load, which is a bad place to find out.
